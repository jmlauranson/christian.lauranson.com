Christian's research focuses on the early Middle Ages (5th - 11th centuries), for which he studied "intermediate rights", aristocratic elites and feudal systems, the Church, canon law and religious orders.

With a doctorate in the history of law from the University of Paris-Nanterre, his thesis, supervised by Jean-Pierre Poly, focused on Auvergne and its margins (Velay, GÃ©vaudan) from the 8th to the 11th century: the end of the ancient world?

In it, he demonstrates the survival/permanence of the values of the Lower Empire, both in terms of law and institutions and in terms of socio-economic structures, culture and mentalities, and the upheaval they underwent around the year 1000, an upheaval caused by the famous "feudal mutation".
